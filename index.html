        • Share prices change based on supply and demand, influenced by company performance, news, and market sentiment.

    <div class="answer">
        • Companies list their shares on stock exchanges through an IPO to raise capital.
        • After listing, shares are traded between investors on exchanges like NSE and BSE.
        • Buyers and sellers place orders through stockbrokers using online platforms.
        • The exchange matches buy and sell orders automatically in real time.
